Therefore, Jew,\\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this,\\n    That, in the course of justice, none of us\\nShould see salvation: we do pray for mercy;\\n    And that same prayer doth teach us all to render\\nThe deeds of mercy.

roads meet here\\n    in me, the traveller and the ways I travel.\\nAll the hills\\' gathered waters feed my seas\\nwho am the swimmer and the mountain river;\\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning

degraded rest and servile toil\\nThe fiery spirit of the seer should call\\nThese simple children of the sun and soil.\\n    O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,\\nYou—you alone, of all the

The rusting mills sprawled gigantically\\nAlong three rivers. The authority of them.\\nThe gritty alleys where we played every evening were\\nStained pink by the inferno always surging in the sky,\\n    As though Christ and the Father were still fashioning the Earth.\\n    Locomotives driving through the cold rain\\nLordly and bestial in their strength.

love is an eager meaninglessness\\nToo tense, or too lax.\\n    They hear in every whisper that speaks to them\\n    A shout and a cry.\\nAs like as not, when they take life over their door-sills\\nThey should let it go by.\\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"They hear in every whisper that speaks to them\"<end_of_turn>\\n<eos>model\\nThe women are so

But I was faithful\\nfor as long as it took.

Now the sea which holds them\\nIs moody, lapping their glossy sides, as if feeling\\nFor some slightest flaw but fails completely\\nToday no race. Then the wind comes again. The yachts\\nMove, jockeying for a start, the signal is set and they\\nAre off. Now the waves strike at them but they are too\\nWell made, they slip through, though they take in canvas\\n    Arms with hands grasping seek to clutch at the prows\\n    Bodies thrown recklessly in the way are cut aside\\nIt is a sea of faces about them in agony, in despair\\nUntil the horror of the race dawns staggering the mind;\\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"Arms with hands grasping seek to clutch at the prows\"<end_of_turn>\\n<eos>model\\nThe yachts are being driven by the wind, but the wind is not strong enough to drive them.

Such are the notes that men have sung\\nGoing to valorous deeds; such tones there were\\nThat helped make history when Time was young.\\nThere is a wide, wide wonder in it all,\\nThat from degraded rest and servile toil\\nThe fiery spirit of the seer should call\\nThese simple children of the sun and soil.\\nO black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,\\nYou—you alone, of all the long, long line\\nOf those who\\'ve sung untaught, unknown, unnamed,\\nHave stretched out upward, seeking the divine.\\n    You sang not deeds of heroes or of kings;\\nNo chant of bloody war, no exulting pean\\nOf arms-won triumphs; but your humble strings\\nYou touched in chord with music empyrean.\\n    You sting far better than you knew; the songs\\nThat for your listeners\\' hungry hearts sufficed\\nStill live,—but more than this to you belongs:\\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"You sang not deeds of heroes or of kings;\\nNo chant of bloody war, no exulting pean\\nOf arms-won triumphs; but your humble strings\\nYou touched in chord with music empyrean.\"<end_of_turn>\\n<eos>model\\nThe “music empyrean” is a reference to the heavens.<end_of_turn><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>', '<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><bos><bos><start_of_turn>user\\nYou are given the poem \"National Trust\" by Tony Harrison.\\n    <poem>\\n    Bottomless pits. There\\'s one in Castleton,\\nand stout upholders of our law and order\\none day thought its depth worth wagering on\\nand borrowed a convict hush-hush from his warder\\nand winched him down; and back, flayed, grey, mad, dumb.\\n    Not even a good flogging made him holler!\\n    O gentlemen, a better way to plumb\\nthe depths of Britain\\'s dangling a scholar,\\nsay, here at the booming shaft at Towanroath,\\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"Not even a good flogging made him holler!\"<end_of_turn>\\n<eos>model\\nThe poem is a scathing critique of the National Trust, which Harrison sees as a symbol of the British class system. The Trust is a charity that owns and manages many of Britain’s most beautiful and historic buildings and gardens. However, Harrison sees the Trust as being more concerned with preserving the past than with the present. He believes that the Trust is a symbol of the British class system, as it is only the wealthy who can afford to visit and enjoy the Trust’s properties.<end_of_turn>', '<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><bos><bos><start_of_turn>user\\nYou are given the poem \"Smell\" by William Carlos Williams.\\n    <poem>\\n    Oh strong-ridged and deeply hollowed\\nNose of mine! what will you not be smelling?\\nWhat tactless asses we are, you and I, boney nose\\nAlways indiscriminate, always unashamed\\nAnd now it is the souring flowers of the bedraggled\\nPoplars: a festering pulp on the wet earth\\nBeneath them. With what deep thirst\\n    We quicken our desires\\nTo that rank odor of a passing springtime!\\n    Can you not be decent? Can you not reserve your ardors\\nFor something less unlovely? What girl will care\\nFor us, do you think, if we continue in these ways?\\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"We quicken our desires\\nTo that rank odor of a passing springtime!\"<end_of_turn>\\n<eos>model\\nThe speaker is referring to the smell of the flowers, which is described as “rank”.

My sister kneels under the rush, a sinner prepared for baptism, while grandmother scrubs as religiously as she scours the toilet each Saturday.\\nGrandmother takes a break to wring and squeeze the towel free\\nof water, soap, and a bricklike, muddy dirt. Child, all that noise\\nisn\\'t necessary. If you could see this nastiness, you\\'d be thanking me.\\nSeeing my sister\\'s distress, I open the door wide.

At first the infant,\\nMewling and puking in the nurse\\'s arms;\\nAnd then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel\\nAnd shining morning face, creeping like snail\\nUnwillingly to school. And then the lover,\\nSighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad\\nMade to his mistress\\' eyebrow. Then a soldier,\\nFull of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,\\nJealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,\\nSeeking the bubble reputation\\nEven in the cannon\\'s mouth. And then the justice,\\n    In fair round belly with good capon lined,\\n    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\\nFull of wise saws and modern instances;\\nAnd so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts\\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"In fair round belly with good capon lined,\"<end_of_turn>\\n<eos>model\\nThe belly is round and full, like a capon (a plump male chicken).<end_of_turn><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>', '<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><bos><bos><start_of_turn>user\\nYou are given the poem \"Sonnet 126\" by William Shakespeare.\\n    <poem>\\n    O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power\\nDost hold Time\\'s fickle glass, his sickle hour;\\nWho hast by waning grown, and therein show\\'st\\nThy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow\\'st.\\nIf Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,\\nAs thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,\\nShe keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill\\nMay time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.\\n    Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!\\n    She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:\\nHer audit (though delay\\'d) answered must be,\\nAnd her quietus is to render thee.\\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!\"<end_of_turn>\\n<eos>model\\nThe speaker is still in love with the subject of the sonnet, but he is also aware of the dangers of love.

From her beacon-hand\\nGlows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command\\nThe air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.\\n\"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!\" cries she\\nWith silent lips. \"Give me your tired, your poor,\\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\\n    The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\\n    Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,\\nI lift my lamp beside the golden door!\\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\"<end_of_turn>\\n<eos>model\\nThe “teeming shore” is a metaphor for the teeming population of the United States.

Whole families shopping at night! Aisles full of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes!\\n--and you, García Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?\\nI saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.\\nI heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What price bananas? Are you my Angel?\\nI wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective.\\nWe strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.\\nWhere are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in a hour. Which way does your beard point tonight?\\n    (I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.)\\n    Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we\\'ll both be lonely.\\nWill we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent cottage?\\nAh, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did you have when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?\\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.)\"<end_of_turn>\\n<eos>model\\nThe speaker is touching Whitman’s book, and dreaming of a shared odyssey in a supermarket.

Whose starward eye\\nSaw chariot “swing low”? And who was he\\nThat breathed that comforting, melodic sigh,\\n“Nobody knows de trouble I see”?\\nWhat merely living clod, what captive thing,\\nCould up toward God through all its darkness grope,\\nAnd find within its deadened heart to sing\\nThese songs of sorrow, love and faith, and hope?\\nHow did it catch that subtle undertone,\\nThat note in music heard not with the ears?\\nHow sound the elusive reed so seldom blown,\\nWhich stirs the soul or melts the heart to tears.\\n    Not that great German master in his dream\\n    Of harmonies that thundered amongst the stars\\nAt the creation, ever heard a theme\\nNobler than “Go down, Moses.” Mark its bars\\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"Not that great German master in his dream\"<end_of_turn>\\n<eos>model\\nThe reference is to Richard Wagner, whose music was often described as “German” and “Romantic”.<end_of_turn><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>', '<bos><bos><start_of_turn>user\\nYou are given the poem \"An Easter Greeting\" by Lewis Carroll.\\n    <poem>\\n    My dear child,\\n    Please to fancy, if you can, that you are reading a real letter, from a real friend whom you have seen, and whose voice you can seem to yourself to hear, wishing you, as I do now with all my heart, a happy Easter.\\n    Do you know that delicious dreamy feeling, when one first wakes on a summer morning, with the twitter of birds in the air, lying lazily with eyes half shut, one sees as in a dream green boughs waving, or waters rippling in a golden light? It is a pleasure very near to sadness, bringing tears to one\\'s eyes like a beautiful picture or poem. And is not that a Mother\\'s gentle hand that undraws your curtains, and a Mother\\'s sweet voice that summons you to rise? To rise and forget, in the bright sunlight, the ugly dreams that frightened you so when all was dark -- to rise and enjoy another happy day, first kneeling to thank that unseen Friend who sends you the beautiful sun?\\nAre these strange words from a writer of such tales as \"Alice\"? And is this a strange letter to find in a book of nonsense? It may be so. Some perhaps may blame me for thus mixing together things grave and gay; others may smile and think it odd that any one should think of solemn things at all, except in Church and on a Sunday: but I think -- nay, I am sure -- that some children will read this gently and lovingly, and in the spirit in which I have written it.\\nFor I do not believe God means us thus to divide life into two halves -- to wear a grave face on Sunday, and to think it out-of-place to even so much as mention Him on a week-day.  Do you think He cares to see only kneeling figures and to hear only tones of prayer -- and that He does not also love to see the lambs leaping in the sunlight, and to hear the merry voices of the children, as they roll among the hay?  Surely their innocent laughter is as sweet in His ears as the grandest anthem that ever rolled up from the \"dim religious light\" of some solemn cathedral?\\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"Please to fancy, if you can, that you are reading a real letter, from a real friend whom you have seen<eos><end_of_turn><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>', '<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><bos><bos><start_of_turn>user\\nYou are given the poem \"Richard II Characters of the Play\" by William Shakespeare.\\n    <poem>\\n    DRAMATIS PERSONAE\\nKING RICHARD THE SECOND\\nQUEEN ISABEL, Duchess of York, wife to King Richard\\nJOHN OF GAUNT, Duke of Lancaster - uncle to the King\\nEDMUND LANGLEY, Duke of York - uncle to the King\\n    HENRY BOLINGBROKE, Duke of Hereford, son of John of Gaunt, afterwards King Henry IV\\n    DUKE OF AUMERLE, son of the Duke of York\\nDUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER, widow of Thomas of Woodstock, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER (uncle to King Richard)\\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY, Duke of Norfolk\\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"HENRY BOLINGBROKE, Duke of Hereford, son of John of Gaunt, afterwards King Henry IV\"<end_of_turn>\\n<eos>model\\nThis is a list of the main characters in the play.<end_of_turn><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos>', '<eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><eos><bos><bos><start_of_turn>user\\nYou are given the poem \"A Miracle For Breakfast\" by Elizabeth Bishop.\\n    <poem>\\n    I can tell what I saw next; it was not a miracle.\\nA beautiful villa stood in the sun\\nand from its doors came the smell of hot coffee.\\nIn front, a baroque white plaster balcony\\nadded by birds, who nest along the river,\\n—I saw it with one eye close to the crumb—\\nand galleries and marble chambers.

Pilate saw me,\\nlooked away, then carefully turned up his sleeves\\nand slowly washed his useless, perfumed hands.\\nThey seized the prophet then and dragged him out,\\nup to the Place of Skulls. My maid knows all the rest.\\n    Was he God? Of course not. Pilate believed he was.\\n    \\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"Was he God? Of course not.

The way the shy stars go stuttering on.\\nAnd at midnight, a candle next to the wine\\nslurs its soft wax, flatters. Shadows\\ncircle the table. The way all faces blur\\nto dream of themselves held in the eyes.\\n    The flare of another match. The way everything dies.\\n    \\n    </poem>\\n    Explain the meaning of the following lines: \"The flare of another match.
